                                <p>The medial and lateral menisci play an important role in absorbing force and
                                    assisting in the role of nourishing the knee joint. An injury can cause altered
                                    biomechanics of the knee joint and pain. This page will explore how and what happens
                                    when the menisci become injured (a tear and/or a rupture). Meniscal tears are the
                                    most common lesions followed by the meniscal cyst. Both of them have 2 causes. The
                                    first one is traumatic and the second one is a degenerative meniscal tear. A
                                    meniscal cyst may present with signs and symptoms consistent with typical meniscal
                                    pathology. The discoid meniscus is a rare congenital disorder where the lateral
                                    meniscus remains around instead of its usual cupped shape leading to instability of
                                    the lateral compartment. This condition is usually asymptomatic but may become
                                    symptomatic if a meniscal tear occurs.

                                    The clinical presentation handles the symptoms associated with a meniscal lesion.
                                    But we have to make the difference between a traumatic meniscal lesion and a
                                    degenerative meniscal lesion. Symptoms for a traumatic meniscal lesion are produced
                                    by instability of the torn fragment. <a href="#cite1" class="cite-link">[1]</a>
                                    These symptoms can result in the locking
                                    of the knee in case of ‘bucket-handle’ tears. It is also responsible for popping of
                                    the knee and you can also hear the knee clicking when the torn part of the meniscus
                                    moves under the femoral condyle. Other more disturbing symptoms include medial or
                                    lateral knee pain depending on the affected compartment, which is caused by an
                                    abnormal increase in tension of the joint capsule.
                                </p>

                                    With a degenerative meniscus the symptoms are the same as in a traumatic meniscal
                                    lesion, although there may also can be problems with the patella or the cartilage.
                                    Symptoms are frequently worsened by flexing and loading the knee, activities such as
                                    squatting and kneeling are poorly tolerated.

                                    surgical treatment when they reflect the natural changes related to the ageing of
                                    meniscal tissue. Two important questions the examiner needs to answer "are the
                                    symptoms related to meniscal problems" and "what is the condition of the articular

                                    In the treatment regimen we recognize conservative means, arthroscopic resection or
                                    a meniscal suture.<a href="#cite6" class="cite-link">[6]</a> Physiotherapy is one
                                    example of conservative treatment; it
                                    focuses on strengthening of the quadriceps muscle to prevent secondary quadriceps
                                    atrophy. This treatment is most successful with an incomplete tear or a small stable
                                    tear in the zone with blood supply. A meniscus tear that shows few, irregular
                                    symptoms, will initially be treated conservatively.</p>
                                <p>Exercise therapy has been suggested to be an effective treatment option for patients
                                    with knee degeneration. The aim of treatment is to improve knee function and limit
                                    joint pain. There is strong evidence that physical training plays an important role
                                    in reducing symptoms, improving muscle strength and physical ability.<a

                                    long, how often? This is the point where
                                    few people agree. The most common recommendation is to apply ice for 20 minutes
                                    every 2 hours for the first 48 to 72 hours. You must take into account that some
                                    people are more sensitive to cold than others are.</p>

                                <P>Strengthening and stretch exercises for quadriceps and hamstrings are important.

                                    The method of advancing strength depends on the timing of the rehabilitation program
                                    but also on the patient response, availability of equipment and the rehabilitation
                                    clinician’s preference.<a href="#cite9" class="cite-link">[9]</a></P>

                                <P>Flexibility exercises and joint mobilization are techniques improve the range of
                                    motion and the flexibility.<a href="#cite10" class="cite-link">[10]</a>

                                    These exercises can be active or passive. The techniques used depend on the type of
                                    tissue.

                                    Prolonged extension stretch is used to increase knee extension. This exercise can be
                                    performed in two positions, prone or long sitting. Prolonged flexion stretch is an
                                    exercise for increasing flexion in the knee. The position used for this exercise
                                    depends on how the flexion movement is present.

                                    Active stretches for quadriceps and hamstrings are also important.</P>
                                <h4>Joint Mobilizations</h4>
                                <hr>
                                <p>Reduced joint mobility could be the result of injury, edema, surgery and
                                    immobilization. If this develops it can refer pain to the knee and even effect ankle
                                    mobility.</p>
                                <p>Joint mobilization is important for the following joints:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Superior Tibiofibular joint;</li>
                                    <li>Patellofemoral joint. Patellar mobility is necessary for full flexion- extension
                                        motion for the knee;</li>
                                    <li>Tibiofemoral joint. It’s the most often mobilized joint to improve range of
                                        motion in the knee.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Balance and agility exercises begin with double-support weight-bearing activities and
